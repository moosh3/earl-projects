## Big Project: Robinhood Trading MCP

**Goal:** Build MCP server for automated options trading to generate income

**Inspiration:** Article about turning $20k → $400k in a year using LLM + MCP
- https://scriptedalchemy.medium.com/from-20k-to-400k-in-a-year-my-llm-options-trading-experiment-1f9d6cecc719

**Plan:**
1. Research Robinhood API options (official or reverse-engineered)
2. Find market data sources (options flow, news, technicals)
3. Build MCP server with:
   - Portfolio reading
   - Market analysis tools
   - Order execution (with safeguards!)
   - Trade history/memory
   - Risk management
4. Test with paper trading first
5. Gradually automate

**Progress:**
1. ✅ Created ~/robinhood-mcp project folder
2. ✅ Researched API options (found robinhood npm package)
3. ✅ Built MCP server framework with stdio transport
4. ✅ Implemented 5 basic tools:
   - get_portfolio (account summary)
   - get_quote (real-time quotes)
   - get_options_positions (options positions)
   - analyze_symbol (comprehensive analysis)
   - get_trade_history (recent orders)

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Research market data APIs (DONE)
2. Start with Tier 1 stack ($50/month):
   - Unusual Whales ($50) for options flow
   - Finnhub (free) for basic data
   - Yahoo Finance (free) for options chains
3. Build MCP tools for data ingestion
4. Get Robinhood credentials
5. Test authentication
6. Paper trade with data analysis
7. Add order execution later (with safeguards!)

**Market Data Research Results:**
- Found 3 tiers: $50, $159, or $149/month
- Recommended: Start with Tier 1 ($50/month)
- Unusual Whales is best for options flow tracking
- Free tools (Finnhub, Yahoo Finance) cover basics
- Upgrade to FMP Premium ($59) once profitable

**Key Principles:**
- Simple prompts, let model decide
- Cache aggressively  
- Human-in-loop for strategy
- Withdraw profits regularly
- Don't be greedy
- **Safety first**: Multiple safeguards before executing trades
